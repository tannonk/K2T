dream, vacation, castle, christmas	Absolutely incredible ---SEP--- My husband and I stewed here for Christmas. And it was everything and more that I've ever dreamed of. Such a majestic hotel, with views that are picture perfect. Our Christmas dinner was gob smacking, the choices and quantity would please anyone. I'd highly recommend a stay at Fairmont Banff Springs, it is a dream come true for me and nothing will ever surpass our stay there. A true winter wonderland.
