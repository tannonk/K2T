Dear Sunlily6336, There is nothing quite like Christmas in the Castle, it truly does become such a magical winter wonderland, we are so glad to learn that you were able to experience that! Thank you for your kind comments and for posting this review, it truly means a lot. We are also glad to know that this was a dream come true vacation for you, being able to be part of that memory for you is something we truly appreciate. We hope you will come back to the Castle again soon! -Fairmont Banff Springs

We love welcoming back our loyal guests and have a sense of pride knowing that Meriton Suites Mascot Central is your preferred choice of accommodation when you travel. Our oversized luxury suites offer more space and freedom for our guests to relax and unwind than a traditional hotel room. We do hope you were able to make full use of our resort style leisure facilities before your onward journey. John_P9764, thank you once again and we do look forward to welcoming you back to Meriton Suites in the near future. Kind regards Todd M Online Reputation Team
Thank you for your positive review and wonderful 10/10 rating. Please let me know what you would like to have on offer in the mini bar as we are currently reviewing this option and may offer this in future. In the interim, we do have a vending machine stocked with snacks and (non alcoholic) drinks on level zero. We hope to see you again when you next visit the region. Kind regards, Cynthia Rice
