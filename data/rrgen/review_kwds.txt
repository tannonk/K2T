dream, vacation, castle, christmas	Absolutely incredible ---SEP--- My husband and I stewed here for Christmas. And it was everything and more that I've ever dreamed of. Such a majestic hotel, with views that are picture perfect. Our Christmas dinner was gob smacking, the choices and quantity would please anyone. I'd highly recommend a stay at Fairmont Banff Springs, it is a dream come true for me and nothing will ever surpass our stay there. A true winter wonderland.
facilities, staff, catering, parking	Fine for the money ---SEP--- Clean rooms Basic facilities Friendly enough staff Catering was below average but we didn’t really mind as it’s not the sort of place and we just ate out Parking is a nightmare though - good luck finding anywhere on the adjacent streets Most of us used the manor car park - it’s free over night - and walked the 3 mins or so to lodge
luxury, suites, leisure, journey	Our favourite hotel near Sydney Airport ---SEP--- This hotel is our go to hotel when we need to travel early from Sydney airport. It is fairly new, and we have stayed there twice (Feb 2017 and Feb 2018). The self-contained one bedroom suite is huge and well appointed, with an excellent bed and full bathroom. It is close to shops, restaurants, and the airport, and for us it has been a great way to start our holiday. We will definitely stay here again when we next have an early flight.
location, quick, minibar	Fantastic ---SEP--- Quick trip to Toowoomba to visit friends and family - Quest provided excellent accommodation and location to all the things we needed to do in 24 hours. Mini bar was the only thing missing otherwise 10/10!
